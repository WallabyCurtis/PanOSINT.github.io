Initially, we need places to organize the effort that goes into this set-up. A few different repositories will be made in order to best coordinate our efforts. As need becomes apparent, a Slack may be developed, and perhaps a Trello.
    We will need a database, and a way to scrape and sort the data from its various forms into this database. Most of the initial focus will be on these areas.
